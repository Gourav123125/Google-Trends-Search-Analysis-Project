# 📈 Google Trends Search Analysis Project

This project leverages Google Trends data to analyze keyword search trends across countries, time, and related topics. It enables data-driven decisions by visualizing user interest, regional demand, and temporal behavior of search terms.

## 📌 Objective

To create a dynamic and reusable tool for analyzing search trends using Google Trends data, allowing marketers, researchers, and analysts to understand keyword popularity over time and across regions.

## 🔍 Business Questions Addressed

1. ✅ How can we write reusable code to search for multiple keywords by changing just one variable?
2. 🌍 What are the **top 15 countries** where the keyword is searched the most?
3. 🗺️ Can we visualize those countries on a **world map**?
4. 📊 What does the **time-wise interest** of the keyword look like — how did it trend across years?
5. 🔍 How can we **compare related keywords** and visualize the results effectively?
